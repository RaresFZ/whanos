# Whanos Project Requirements Compliance

## ✅ Fully Implemented

### Supported Languages
- ✅ C (GCC 13.2, Makefile detection)
- ✅ Java (Java SE 21, Maven with pom.xml)
- ✅ JavaScript (Node.js 20.9, package.json)
- ✅ Python (3.12, requirements.txt)
- ✅ Befunge (Befunge-93 via pyfunge, main.bf)

### Whanos Images
- ✅ Base images for all 5 languages
- ✅ Standalone images for all 5 languages
- ✅ Images use official base images
- ✅ Images work in /app directory
- ✅ Proper dependency installation
- ✅ Source cleanup after compilation (C, Java)

### Jenkins Structure (NOW AUTOMATED)
- ✅ Admin user with "admin" ID and full rights
- ✅ Sign-up disabled
- ✅ "Whanos base images" folder created automatically
- ✅ "Projects" folder created automatically
- ✅ Individual base image build jobs (whanos-c, whanos-java, etc.)
- ✅ "Build all base images" job
- ✅ link-project job with parameters

### Jenkins Jobs
- ✅ Base image jobs build respective Dockerfiles
- ✅ Build all base images triggers all jobs
- ✅ link-project creates new jobs in Projects folder
- ✅ Created jobs poll SCM every minute (`* * * * *`)
- ✅ Jobs containerize applications automatically
- ✅ Jobs push to Docker registry

### Kubernetes Integration (NOW AUTOMATED)
- ✅ Cluster deployed with Ansible
- ✅ 2+ nodes capable (configurable in inventory)
- ✅ whanos.yml deployment support
- ✅ Replica configuration
- ✅ Resource limits support
- ✅ Port forwarding support
- ✅ Registry authentication automated (imagePullSecrets)
- ✅ Containerd certificate trust automated

### Infrastructure Deployment
- ✅ Ansible playbooks for full deployment
- ✅ Idempotent playbooks
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Docker registry with Caddy reverse proxy
- ✅ Self-signed TLS for registry

### Documentation
- ✅ README.md with project overview
- ✅ kubernetes.md with K8s deployment info
- ✅ provisioning.md with infrastructure setup
- ✅ registry.md with registry details
- ✅ security.md with security considerations
- ✅ automated-deployment.md (NEW)

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented

### Private Repository Support
- ⚠️ Supported through credentials_id parameter in link-project
- ⚠️ Needs documentation on how to add credentials via Jenkins UI
- ⚠️ Could add automation for credential creation

### Port Accessibility
- ⚠️ Ports are exposed via Kubernetes
- ⚠️ Method works but could improve documentation
- ⚠️ Could add LoadBalancer or Ingress automation

## 🔧 Improvements Needed for Production

### Security Hardening
1. **Default Credentials**: Currently using admin/changeme and ci/changeme
   - Should be configurable via environment variables
   - Should generate random passwords on first deploy
   - Should store securely (e.g., Ansible Vault)

2. **TLS Certificates**: Using self-signed certificates
   - Should support Let's Encrypt
   - Should support custom CA certificates
   - Currently only works on local network

3. **Network Security**:
   - Registry accessible from anywhere
   - Jenkins accessible from anywhere
   - Should add firewall rules / network policies

### Multi-Node Support
- Currently optimized for single-node (removes control-plane taint)
- Works with multi-node but needs worker join command handling
- Documentation could be clearer on multi-node setup

### Example Applications
- ✅ Example apps exist in `whanos_example_apps/`
- ⚠️ Not automatically deployed/tested
- Could add integration tests

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### For Evaluation Defense
1. ✅ Test the link-project job
2. ✅ Demonstrate automatic polling and building
3. ✅ Show whanos.yml deployment working
4. ✅ Demonstrate base image rebuilding
5. Document how to add Git credentials for private repos

### For Production Readiness
1. Change all default credentials
2. Implement proper TLS (Let's Encrypt or corporate CA)
3. Add network security (firewall, network policies)
4. Add monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
5. Add logging aggregation (ELK stack)
6. Implement backup/restore procedures
7. Add integration tests
8. Create runbooks for common operations
